== Usage

1. Install Ruby ( Ruby version 3.0 and greater )
2. Install bundler: `gem install bundler`
3. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Run the program: `bin/bookview`

== Set-Up Instructions

To use this application, clone this repo to your local with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/BenjaminNeustadt/8th_light_test.git`

Ensure that you have Ruby downloaded on your system, you can check by inputting `ruby -v` into your terminal.

Run `bundle install` to ensure you have all the correct dependencies of this project.

== Using the Program

From within the root directory of the program,
in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
bin/bookview
----

OR

[source, sh]
----
ruby bin/bookview
----

Follow the prompts to search for a book query.
Insert any word to get a return of 5 books that match your query.
Follow the prompts to add the book to a reading list.

[IMPORTANT]
(Please note, the queries will only be matched via the Google Books API
if you set the program to online - instructions below; else it will use persistent test data.)

== To use this program live

NOTE: If you would like to use this program online, the steps will be as follows:

1. Setup your own google Books *API key*, {url-google-api-medium}[this article] is very helpful
2. create a '.env' file in the root directory with `touch .env` and insert your API key (example below)
3. You can now use the program live

.Example `.env`
[source, .env]
----
#.env file
API_KEY = [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]<1>
----
<1>Remove your .env file from version control

== Testing

The testing framework used is Rspec.

.To run the tests:
[source, sh]
----
rspec -fd
----

Code coverage is reported when running the tests (currently 100%).

== Process

Following is some of the initial planning,
followed by some revisoinary CRC modelling post review.

*Post review revisions*

[NOTE]
Not all of these constants have been implemented (specifically the 3 modules);
and BookView has not been refactored accordingly.
However, this is a design that feels like it would adhere more correctly to the Single Responsibility Principle,
and other SOLID priniciples.

== Post review

*_Question_*
****
With the Single Responsibility Principle in mind,
what are all of the responsibilities of the bin/bookview.rb script in its current form?
Given the time, how might you refactor so that the script has a single responsibility?
****

Currently the responsibilities of bin/bookview.rb are numerous:

* running the script/loop
* holding two constants for later use within this file
* instantiating an instance of the 'BookStorage' class
* containing methods used within script

=== Extracting and Refactoring

Initially when writing this script I followed a sort of procedural programming process.
However, I would definitely like to improve this.

I have diagramed what I feel would be my ideal finished program (revised CRC above).

The script would comprise calling an instance of `BookView.new`, called 'session',
and then use methods on that instance to output the respective 'reports' within each `when` conditional inside the loop;
this way, we would only need to use `puts` once to output the return of each method. We would also DRY the code considerably.
`BookView.new` would be placed inside the lib folder. The script's responsibility would therefore be to execute an instance of `BookView`, getting input and passing that input
to BookView through its methods. In a way, the script would therefore be analogous to a front end, if we follow the design analogy initially used.

I would have to switch off the colorization, and use testing to match the current outputs.
Case 4 and 0 would both use the same method, though could be given an argument defining the border "style" to be used,
these styles would be stored inside a module I called "Decorators" (in revised CRC model). I like this approach as then the borders become customisable,
and we can easily add a new style to these borders later on.

I would favour using heredocs to build the strings inside of these reports,
as then I feel the string format would be easier to modify from within constants containing the string format.
In this way I think we could more easily adhere to SRP and have modularity,
as we every module would and class would only hold methods that serve a specific type of functionality.

I also think that heredocs would promote better readability for the next dev joining the project.

The trade-off I can imagine having to face is the colorization of specific lines for these reports;
we would only be able to colorize the string in its entirety.

Ultimately, the refactor would comprise of:

* *class* BookView
* *module* Report
* *module* Decorators
* *module* Prompt
* *script* bin/bookfind

BookView would have access to all the report methods on the Report module.
I believe it only needs be a module, as we do not need to create state for it.

== Automating the environment outside of the code

Currently the environment (test or live data) is set by choosing which class object to instantiate when using 'BookSearch' from within the loop.

_My reasoning for this change:_

I hesitated on this point, though decided that the functioanlity of the `OFFLINE'
constant (to toggle the integration on and off) could be achieved in another way.
I used {url-config}[The Twelve-Factor App III.Config] to partly inform this decision,
as well as the open/close principle.
It felt like having constants that changed the environment configuration of the program inside the code was not ideal,
and I know you alluded to this also in the beginning of the review.

Ideally, a degree of automation in regards the "connection" to test-data or live data could be achieved by using a config file,
in order to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
and to offer maximum portability between execution environments.

Currently I have tried to adher to the Open/Close principle by using the strategy pattern that was encouraged in the code review.
Initially, what I had done was include an `if else` statement in 'BookData',
the class was therefore initially responsible for checking whether the `OFFLINE` constant was set to `true` or `false`.

However, following the recommendation to use the strategy pattern in the review,
I thought it would be beneficial to extract these even further into separate classes, and pass them in as an argument to 'BookSearch',

I think that using {url-dotenv}['dotenv'] is a suitable compromise.
In so doing, we set the "connection" configuration in the top of the script file 'bin/bookview'
(that would at this point in the refactor be 'bin/bookfind').
We could then choose which object to create (and thereby which data to retrieve, live or test)
depending on whether the ENV is existant in the '.env' file.
If an API_KEY is exitant the program is connected automatically, if the developer wants to work in a test environment,
then they can simply comment it out. The '.env' is therefore the only file that switches the program's environment.

In order to not stray from SRP we could then extract this "connection" configuration into its own file as a simple method,
and then call it from within the script (i.e. `data = connection_environment`):
this would then pass in the appropriate argument to `BookSearch.new(data)`.

In regards to readability and understanding, I feel that even if some of the classes are doing the correct thing,
the naming is not always quite right. For instance, 'BookSearch' should perhaps be named 'BookParse' -
as that is what this class is actually doing.
Also the parse methods inside of 'BookData', and 'TestData' should perhaps be titled as 'connection'.

== Reappropriate tests to `booksearch_spec.rb`

As part of the post-review revision I have moved the tests previously in `end_to_end_spec.rb`,
as the behaviours we are testing there seem to be the responsibility of `BookSearch`.
