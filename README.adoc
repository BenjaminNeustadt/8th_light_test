== Instructions

Create a command line application that allows you to use the
Google Books API to search for books and construct a reading list.

You do not have to use a private GitHub repo for this.

_This application should allow you to:_

1. Type in a query and display a list of *5 books matching that query.*
2. Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing
  company.
3. A user should be able to select a book from the five displayed to save to a
  “Reading List” View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected
  from their queries
  - this is a local reading list and not tied to Google
  Books’s account features.
4. For programming language, choose any language you want as long as it is not
  the same language you chose to review in the Code Review section above.
5. Feel free to use a library (or not) for the Google Books call or JSON parsing.

Please do not add any additional features.

Your submission doesn’t need to be perfect.

After we receive your submission we'll review your code, respond to you with
our feedback and suggestions, and give you an opportunity to respond to our
feedback and make improvements to your code before you re-submit a second and
final version.

That said, we would still like to see your best work with the first version you submit.
It should demonstrate external quality (for example: solves the problem,
handles edge cases, usability), internal quality (for example:
*decoupling*, *testing*, *readability*), as well as some idea of your process and
approach (via your version control history and README).

= Usage

To use this application, clone this repo to your local with the following command:

`git clone [repo]`

The API key used in this project is restricted (mine) so head {url-google-api}[here] and follow the instructions to set up your own API KEY.
A formatted environement will be included so that a user need only insert their personal API_KEY into there, manually.

As a stretch goal, we could consider creating a sample environement file that gets copied for the formatting (as a template file; so that a new API_KEY can be inserted).
Ensure that you have Ruby downloaded on your system, you can check by inputting `ruby -v` into your terminal.

run `bundle install` to ensure you have all the correct dependencies of this project.

I use {url-google-api-medium}[this article]to set up the google api key correctly:

Go {url-google-console}[here] to enable 'Books API',
when we type the following into the browser search we get the return of raw json data:

'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=history&key=AIzaSyDTsdQz7h-sK8Kf3shcnXrsLT1rWj5PYak'

(Though one of the tests will check the connection is valid for us.)

= Testing

== HTTP connection

Although this may not be necessary in the long run,
it is useful to know whether we are getting a vald http response from a default api call.

We wrote dummy data to a file through the command line, using the following command:

`curl "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=history&key=[API_KEY]" -o test_data1.json`

We can then `bat` the file to see the file properly formatted.

= Storage

I am wondering whether to make the "storage" of books temporary to the existance of the class,
or whether to make it persist beyond the running of the program in the terminal.
The second option would mean having the data written to a storage file, similar to 'test_data.json'.

In order for this to work, the file in question would have to be gitignored,
so that the saved data is only accessible to the respective user,
so that the data is not passed on were the program to be passed on.
