= Usage

1. Set up an API KEY
2. Install Ruby
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the program: `ruby bin/bookview.rb`

== Set-Up Instructions

To use this application, clone this repo to your local with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/BenjaminNeustadt/8th_light_test.git`


Ensure that you have Ruby downloaded on your system, you can check by inputting `ruby -v` into your terminal.

Run `bundle install` to ensure you have all the correct dependencies of this project.

****
[NOTE]
====
To run this program "online", you will need to set up your own API key via google api.
With that done you can make a 'env.json'.

.The following snippet is the correct template to use:
[source, json]
----
// env.json file

{ "API_KEY" : "[YOUR API KEY]" } <1>
----
<1> You will only need one set of quotation marks surrounding the key.
====
****

.To enable a true connection to online environement and get real data return
[source, ruby]
----
# bin/bookview.rb file

require_relative '../lib/booksearch'
require 'colorize'

OFFLINE = true    <---<1>
MENU = {
  ACTION: {
    1 => "search",
    2 => "view search results",
    3 => "add",
    4 => "view",
    0 => "exit"
  }
}
----
<1> Change the word "true" to "false".
Make sure you have updated/saved the file.

The program can now be used "online"

== Using the Program

From within the root directory of the program,
in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
ruby bin/bookview.rb
----

Follow the prompts to search for a book query.
You can insert any word and will be given a return of 5 books that match your query.
Follow the prompts to add the book to a reading list.

= Testing

The testing framework used is Rspec.

[IMPORTANT]
The application is by default switched to "ONLINE" with `OFFLINE = true`,
this means that the data used to run the app will always be dummy data.
This is done to ensure optimal testing grounds for the test environement,
and to adher to the brief.

.To run the tests:
[source, sh]
----
rspec -fd
----

If the program is set to "ONLINE", by setting `OFFLINE` to `false` in the 'bookview.rb',
one of the tests will check a valid http connection (otherwise,
it will use a test_data file to validate).

= Process

Following is some of the planning and side thoughts throughout.

== Storage

I am wondering whether to make the "storage" of books temporary to the existance of the class,
or whether to make it persist beyond the running of the program in the terminal.
The second option would mean having the data written to a storage file, similar to 'test_data.json'.

In order for this to work, the file in question would have to be gitignored,
so that the saved data is only accessible to the respective user,
so that the data is not passed on were the program to be passed on.

== Stretch goals

As another goal I would like to add a test for the "front-end"
(the command-line user interface).

= Initial Brief

Create a command line application that allows you to use the
Google Books API to search for books and construct a reading list.

You do not have to use a private GitHub repo for this.

_This application should allow you to:_

1. Type in a query and display a list of *5 books matching that query.*
2. Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing
  company.
3. A user should be able to select a book from the five displayed to save to a
  “Reading List” View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected
  from their queries
  - this is a local reading list and not tied to Google
  Books’s account features.
4. For programming language, choose any language you want as long as it is not
  the same language you chose to review in the Code Review section above.
5. Feel free to use a library (or not) for the Google Books call or JSON parsing.

Please do not add any additional features.

Your submission doesn’t need to be perfect.

After we receive your submission we'll review your code, respond to you with
our feedback and suggestions, and give you an opportunity to respond to our
feedback and make improvements to your code before you re-submit a second and
final version.

That said, we would still like to see your best work with the first version you submit.
It should demonstrate external quality (for example: solves the problem,
handles edge cases, usability), internal quality (for example:
*decoupling*, *testing*, *readability*), as well as some idea of your process and
approach (via your version control history and README).

= Damon_review

== Positive

* Text-based user interfaces can be overwhelming. I appreciated your use of color to help discriminate different text that you presented.

* You handled all of the edge cases common to these types of submissions, such as multiple authors, no publisher, empty search, etc.

* In command-line applications, it is common to use gets and puts throughout the application,
  which makes it hard to have a unified channel to send and receive information to the user.
  I liked that you only used gets and puts in a single module/file here.

* You included specs, and they are all passing!

== Opportunities for Improvement

=== API Key

Keeping secrets like API keys out of version control is good practice.
I noticed that the env.json contained a preconfigured API key.
I am not sure if that is a valid API key or if it is intended as a placeholder,
but I wanted to provide that feedback for completeness.

At any rate, an API key is not required to satisfy the requirements of this application.
(See related feedback below about the README.)

=== Outdated README

I attempted to follow the steps provided in the README, but I found that some of them no longer applied, such as:

* Creating and configuring an API key. I did not need to complete this to use and run the application.[x]
* Enabling/disabling the integration test with the Google Books API.[x]
* There is a command to run the tests, but I had to update the Gemfile to run them because rspec was omitted. [x]
* There are instructions for installing colorizor but it is included in the Gemfile.[x]

=== Unused Code

I noticed a few areas where there is code that is not used.

* The connection_spec is only enabled when $DEBUG is true, but that flag is never enabled, and there doesn’t seem to be a mechanism to enable it.[x]
* The add method in the BookSearch is only exercised by its spec [ ]
  The result is that the test is never executed.[ ]

=== Fuzzy Boundaries

I like that you encapsulated the Google Books API interaction inside the BookSearch class.
I also like that you included a way to toggle the integration on and off!

However, is it the responsibility of BookSearch to know how to read test_data.json and how to make an HTTP request to the API?

Additionally, you have two spec files that each test one of these responsibilities.
`bookstorage_spec` tests the _offline_ flow, and `end_to_end_spec` tests the _online_ flow.
This bifurcation of tests indicates multiple responsibilities because neither test tests all of the paths of execution.

How might you refactor so that the `BookSearch` only has a single responsibility?
There are multiple ways to achieve this, but one way that I like is the *strategy pattern*,
which likely means introducing additional classes.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I clarify here.

=== Questions

Please take the time to reply to the questions below,
but note that no implementation, updates, or refactoring are required for these questions.
I am merely interested in your response!

With the Single Responsibility Principle in mind,
what are all of the responsibilities of the bin/bookview.rb script in its current form?
Given the time, how might you refactor so that the script has a single responsibility?

Please consider my notes and take the opportunity to refactor your code to complete this step in your interview process.
This second and final submission is needed on or before Wednesday of next week (01/04).
